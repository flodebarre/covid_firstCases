This repository gathers data on early cases in Wuhan from different sources, and provides a way to visualise and compare these early epidemic curves.

⚠️ The earliest epidemic curves are known to be incomplete. They are shown here because they make it possible to see where cases that were later retrospectively found are placed on the epidemic curves.  

Unless specified, the data were manually extracted, using [WebPlotDigitizer](https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/) for the most complex figures.


# Visualization

A tool to visualise and compare the different curves is available at <https://flodebarre.github.io/covid_firstCases/visualization.html>. It was coded by [Babarlelephant](https://github.com/babarlelephant).

# Notes

-  Explanations for the discrepancies between WHO 2021 and previous versions, given in the WHO report (p47, main document)

> Three possible cases with disease onset on 1, 2 and 7 December 2019, respectively, were initially identified as potential cases in the retrospective case search and have been included in some published papers. Clinical review of these three cases by the Chinese expert team led to their exclusion as possible cases on the basis of the clinical features of their illness.  
> In the case with onset on 1 December, a 62-year-old man with past history of cerebrovascular disease was judged to have had a minor respiratory illness in early December, which responded to antibiotics. He developed a further illness with onset on 26 December 2019, which was later laboratory- confirmed to be COVID-19. This patient had no reported contact to the Huanan market, whereas his wife, who was admitted on 26 December with a COVID-19 compatible illness, reported close contact with the Huanan market. She was also later laboratory-confirmed to have COVID-19. This couple, together with their son, became part of the first recognized family cluster of COVID-19.  
> In the second case, a 34-year-old woman with onset on 2 December 2019 was assessed to have had venous thromboembolic disease and subsequently pneumonia. She remained negative on SARS-CoV- 2 laboratory testing throughout a longer admission period ending in mid-February 2020.  
> In the third case, a 51-year-old man with onset on 7 December 2019 had symptoms of a cold and fever, and chest X-ray changes (“thickness of texture of both lungs and stripes”). His blood neutrophil count was raised and specific antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae were detected. He responded well to antibiotics. Blood collected in April 2020 was reported negative for SARS-CoV-2-specific
antibodies.

-  A [March 2020 article in SCMP](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3074991/coronavirus-chinas-first-confirmed-covid-19-case-traced-back) (available without paywall [here](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/coronavirus-china-first-confirmed-covid-152553818.html)) was claiming a case on Nov 2019 and 266 cases by the end of the year. The 266 number potentially refers to 174 (notified to NNDRS) plus 92 (compatible earlier cases reviewed) mentioned p.7 of the WHO 2021 report.
