Streptococcus pneumoniae was positive, other pathogens were negative.
4. Analysis of the cause of
the disease (1) Currently in the epidemic period of respiratory diseases, the market has a high concentration of people, poor ventilation, and poor sanitary environment, which are the objective reasons for the occurrence of the cases.

关于医院报告华南海鲜市场多例肺炎病 例情况的

调查处置报告


2019年12月29日下午，接到省、市卫生健康委通知，近期省中西医结合医院、市中心医院后湖院区等医院收治多例症状相似的肺炎病例，有华南海鲜市场暴露史，为查明疫情性质和波及范围，立即启动应急处置工作流程，省、市疾控中心会同江汉、硚口、东西湖区疾控中心赶赴现场开展流行病学调查、标本采集检测、院感控制等处置工作，现将调查处置情况报告如下:
一、基本情况
华南海鲜市场位于江汉区，东、西两个区域共摊位650余个，从业人员1500余人。西区卫生环境很差，销售垃圾随处堆放，地面潮湿，通风很差。此次患者主要分布在西区12个摊位、东区1个摊位有17人，另有市场非固定摊位工作人员3人。
二、现场流行病学调查
（一）病例定义
2019年12月1日以来，我市医疗机构收治的有华南海鲜市场暴露史以及病例的家庭成员被诊断为肺炎的病例，且未排除其它病原体感染者。
（二）病例分布
累计搜索病例25例，完成流行病学调查核实20例。分布如下：
1、人群分布：年龄介于31~78岁，主要集中于40~60岁14例。男14例、女6例，男女比2.33:1。其中有2个家庭成员有在该市场共同暴露，其中患者一兰小标家庭存在家庭成员（夫妻：兰小标、祁燕霞，兰小标哥哥兰兵标，兰小标岳父祁喜山），患者二陈三红及其母亲（邱风兰）。
2、时间分布：调查病例的最早发病时间12月12日，最后一例为12月25日，发病曲线如下图。





3、医院分布：目前现就诊医院为市金银潭医院4例、市中心医院后湖院区7例、同济医院8例、居家1例。
（三）临床诊断
经医疗机构诊断，调查的20例病例肺炎/肺部感染19例、发热待查1例。
三、实验室检测
（一）省中西医结合医院
先后对收治的5例患者开展甲型、乙型流感抗原（咽拭子），呼吸道病原抗体5项检测，12月27日在1例患者血液中检出腺病毒IgM阳性，其它患者均为阴性。
（二）市中心医院后湖院区
先后对收治的1例开展呼吸道病毒抗体7项、4例开展甲流抗原快检均为阴性。
（三）同济医院
对收治的7例患者开展了呼吸道病毒抗体9项，均为阴性。
（四）市疾控中心
12月29日晚上、30日凌晨，先后2批对采集的17份患者的咽拭子标本开展流感病毒、上呼吸道病原（20种）开展核酸检测，检出5份肺炎链球菌阳性，其它病原均为阴性。
四、发病原因分析
（一）目前处于呼吸道疾病流行期，该市场人群聚集性高，通风较差，卫生环境恶劣，为病例的发生客观原因。
（二）从调查20例病例的结果来看，绝大部分患者发病早期在个体诊所或社区卫生服务中心就诊，或者自行购买药物在家服药治疗，导致疾病加重后才前往综合医院规范治疗。
（三）目前未发现该市场聚集性病例，患者摊位较分散，无明显接触交叉，无时间和空间上的聚集性，仅有华南生鲜市场的暴露史。
五、已采取措施
（一）对该市场进行详细的现场流行病学调查，目前只发现13个摊位发生病例。
（二）省、市、区对报告的肺炎病例开展了现场核实和详细的流行病学调查，摸清了发病与就诊经过及可疑暴露情况。
（三）采集17例患者的标本开展了流感等20种病原体检测。
市疾控中心于12月30日上午采集华南海鲜市场外环境标本12份，结果待查。
六、下一步处置建议
（一）市场监督部门加强该市场卫生环境综合整理，切实做好环境清洗消毒，日常通风等工作。
（二）卫生健康部门进一步加强该市场从业相关人群的不明原因疾病的监测工作，做好对可疑患者的早发现、早排查、早处置工作。
（三）各医疗机构进一步规范发热门诊的运行和预检分诊，早期开展流感等病原的筛查，早期明确诊断和规范治疗，做好感染控制工作。
